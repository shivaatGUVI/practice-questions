/*
    - Write a function with two parameters where first would be a boolean (true/false) value, second would be a string.
    - The default boolean value should be false if the value is not passed to the function as an argument for some reason.
    - Depending upon the boolean value print the following: -
        i) If the boolean value is true concatenate the second variable with "-hello" and return it.
        ii) If the boolean value is false return "Cannot send the number"
