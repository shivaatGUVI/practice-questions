/*
    - Write a function with two parameters where both of them would be numbers.
    - The default value for first parameter should be 20 and second should be 10 if the values are not passed to the function as an argument for some reason.
    - Depending upon the condition do the following: - 
        i) If both the parameters are not passed then return 404 and print "Default values".
        ii) If both the parameters are passed then return the addition of them and print "Added the parameters".
        iii) If any one of them is passed them print "Only one parameter is passed".
